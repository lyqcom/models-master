# Description

MindSpore distributed training launch helper utility that will generate hccl config file.

## hccl_tools.py

This script is used to generate a rank_table_file for single server by using `hccl_tool` or read `/etc/hccn.conf`.

### Usage

```bash
python hccl_tools.py --device_num "[0,8)"
```

output:

```bash
hccl_[device_num]p_[which device]_[server_ip].json
```

### Note

Please note that the Ascend accelerators used must be continuous, such [0,4) means to use four chips 0，1，2，3; [0,1) means to use chip 0; The first four chips are a group, and the last four chips are a group. In addition to the [0,8) chips are allowed, other cross-group such as [3,6) are prohibited.

`--visible_devices` means the visible devices according to the software system. Usually used in the virtual system or docker container that makes the device_id dismatch logic_id. `--device_num` uses logic_id. For example "4,5,6,7" means the system has 4 logic chips which are actually the last 4 chips in hardware while `--device_num` could only be set to "[0, 4)" instead of "[4, 8)"

`hccl_tools` used `/etc/hccn.conf` to generate rank_table_file. `/etc/hccn.conf` is the configuration file about ascend accelerator resources.

## merge_hccl

This script is used to merge server rank_table_file for single server into one file for the cluster.

### Usage

```bash
python merge_hccl.py hccl_1.json hccl_2.json
# or
python merge_hccl.py hccl*.json
```

output:

```bash
hccl_[server_count]s_[rank_size]p.json
```

### Note

Please note that, the server order in the output config file comes from the order of input file list.

For example, running `python merge_hccl.py hccl_1.json hccl_2.json`. The 8 devices in hccl_1.json will be rank `0~7`, and the 8 devices in hccl_2.json will be rank `8~15`.

While running with wildcard, the exact order is not determined, which is decided by the system. Usually this will result in dictionary order just like `ls` command, but we still suggest you check the result carefully if the order does matter in your situation.

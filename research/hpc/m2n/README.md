# Mesh Movement Networks for PDE Solvers

To cater to an abrupt requirement, this repository is hastily created to for the purpose of a [MindSpore](https://www.mindspore.cn/) implementation of the work [M2N: Mesh Movement Networks for PDE Solvers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.11188), to the best of our knowledge the first learning-based end-to-end mesh movement framework that can greatly accelerate the mesh adaptation process by 3 to 4 orders of magnitude, whilst achieving comparable numerical error reduction to traditional sota methods.

Our code is originally written in PyTorch. We plan to translate it into MindSpore and release the code before the end of 2022.

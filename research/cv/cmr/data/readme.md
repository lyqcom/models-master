The directory called "data" is used for preprocessing dataset and transfer Pytorch checkpoint to Mindspore checkpoint, but is empty initially.

Therefore, before running the generate dataset script, you need to download data.zip file from [Baidu Netdisk](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1jMBIDCGicfFROLBCE9YP7w?pwd=bwq0) and extract the files from data.zip to this data directory.

Additionally, you also need to download smpl.ckpt and mesh.ckpt from [Public Server](https://download.mindspore.cn/thirdparty/cmr/) to this data directory.

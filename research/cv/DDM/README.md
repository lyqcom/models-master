# Semi-Supervised Domain Adaptation based on Dual-level Domain Mixing for Semantic Segmentation (DDM)

This repository is an official implementation of the paper "Semi-Supervised Domain Adaptation based on Dual-level Domain Mixing for Semantic Segmentation" from CVPR 2021.

Data-driven based approaches, in spite of great success in many tasks, have poor generalization when applied to unseen image domains, and require expensive cost of annotation especially for dense pixel prediction tasks such as semantic segmentation. We focus on a more practical setting of semi-supervised domain adaptation (SSDA) where both a small set of labeled target data and large amounts of labeled source data are available. We propose a novel framework based on dual-level domain mixing, named DDM, to address the task of SSDA. The proposed framework consists of three stages. First, two kinds of data mixing methods are proposed to reduce domain gap in both region-level and sample-level respectively. We can obtain two complementary domain-mixed teachers based on dual-level mixed data from holistic and partial views respectively. Then, a student model is learned by distilling knowledge from these two teachers. Finally, pseudo labels of unlabeled data are generated in a self-training manner for another few rounds of teachers training. Extensive experimental results have demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed framework on synthetic-to-real semantic segmentation benchmarks.

# For example: For 100 labeled target images on GTA5->Cityscapes:
python eval.py --data_path ./data/cityscapes/ --pretrained ./weights/100/best_model.ckpt
```

### Evaluation Result

The result are evaluated by the value of mIoU.

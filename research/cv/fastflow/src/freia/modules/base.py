    r"""Base class for all invertible modules in FrEIA.

    Given ``module``, an instance of some InvertibleModule.
    This ``module`` shall be invertible in its input dimensions,
    so that the input can be recovered by applying the module
    in backwards mode (``rev=True``), not to be confused with
    ``pytorch.backward()`` which computes the gradient of an operation::
        x = torch.randn(BATCH_SIZE, DIM_COUNT)
        c = torch.randn(BATCH_SIZE, CONDITION_DIM)
        # Forward mode
        z, jac = module([x], [c], jac=True)
        # Backward mode
        x_rev, jac_rev = module(z, [c], rev=True)
    The ``module`` returns :math:`\\log \\det J = \\log \\left| \\det \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} \\right|`
    of the operation in forward mode, and
    :math:`-\\log | \\det J | = \\log \\left| \\det \\frac{\\partial f^{-1}}{\\partial z} \\right| =
        -\\log \\left| \\det \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} \\right|`
    in backward mode (``rev=True``).
    Then, ``torch.allclose(x, x_rev) == True`` and ``torch.allclose(jac, -jac_rev) == True``.

        Perform a forward (default, ``rev=False``) or backward pass (``rev=True``) through this module/operator.

        **Note to implementers:**
        - Subclasses MUST return a Jacobian when ``jac=True``, but CAN return a
          valid Jacobian when ``jac=False`` (not punished). The latter is only recommended
          if the computation of the Jacobian is trivial.
        - Subclasses MUST follow the convention that the returned Jacobian be
          consistent with the evaluation direction. Let's make this more precise:
          Let :math:`f` be the function that the subclass represents. Then:
          .. math::
              J &= \\log \\det \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} \\\\
              -J &= \\log \\det \\frac{\\partial f^{-1}}{\\partial z}.
          Any subclass MUST return :math:`J` for forward evaluation (``rev=False``),
          and :math:`-J` for backward evaluation (``rev=True``).

        Args:
            x_or_z: input data (array-like of one or more tensors)
            c:      conditioning data (array-like of none or more tensors)

        MUST be implemented for each subclass of ``InvertibleModule``.

        Args:
          input_dims: A list with one entry for each input to the module.
            Even if the module only has one input, must be a list with one
            entry. Each entry is a tuple giving the shape of that input,
            excluding the batch dimension. For example for a module with one
            input, which receives a 32x32 pixel RGB image, ``input_dims`` would
            be ``[(3, 32, 32)]``

        Returns:
            A list structured in the same way as ``input_dims``. Each entry
            represents one output of the module, and the entry is a tuple giving
            the shape of that output. For example if the module splits the image
            into a right and a left half, the return value should be
            ``[(3, 16, 32), (3, 16, 32)]``. It is up to the implementor of the
            subclass to ensure that the total number of elements in all inputs
            and all outputs is consistent.

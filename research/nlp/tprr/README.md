# [Thinking Path Re-Ranker](#contents)

Thinking Path Re-Ranker(TPRR) was proposed in 2021 by Huawei Poisson Lab & Parallel Distributed Computing Lab. [Answer Complex Questions: Path Ranker Is All You Need](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3404835.3462942). By incorporating the
retriever, reranker and reader modules, TPRR shows excellent performance on open-domain multi-hop question answering. Moreover, TPRR has won
the first place in the current HotpotQA official leaderboard. This is a example of evaluation of TPRR with HotPotQA dataset in MindSpore. More
importantly, this is the first open source version for TPRR.

# [Model Architecture](#contents)

Specially, TPRR contains three main modules. The first is retriever, which generate document sequences of each hop iteratively. The second
is reranker for selecting the best path from candidate paths generated by retriever. The last one is reader for extracting answer spans.

# [Dataset](#contents)

The dataset of re-ranker consists of two parts:

> 1. [Wikipedia data](https://github.com/AkariAsai/learning_to_retrieve_reasoning_paths/tree/master/retriever): the 2017 English Wikipedia dump version.
> 2. [dev data](https://hotpotqa.github.io): HotPotQA full wiki setting dev data with 7398 question-answer pairs.

you can download preprocess data from [here](https://obs.dualstack.cn-north-4.myhuaweicloud.com/mindspore-website/notebook/tprr/data.zip)

# [Features](#contents)

## [Mixed Precision](#contents)

To ultilize the strong computation power of Ascend chip, and accelerate the evaluation process, the mixed evaluation method is used. MindSpore
is able to cope with FP32 inputs and FP16 operators. In TPRR example, the model is set to FP16 mode for the matmul calculation part.

# [Environment Requirements](#contents)

- Hardware (Ascend)
- Framework
    - [MindSpore](https://www.mindspore.cn/install/en)

    - [MindSpore Python API](https://www.mindspore.cn/docs/en/master/index.html)

# [Quick Start](#contents)

After installing MindSpore via the official website and Dataset is correctly generated, you can start training and evaluation as follows.

- running on Ascend

  ```python
  # run evaluation example with HotPotQA dev dataset
  pip install transformers
  bash run_eval_ascend.sh
  bash run_eval_ascend_reranker_reader.sh
  ```

## [Script Parameters](#contents)

Parameters for retriever evaluation can be set in config.py.

- config for TPRR retriever

  ```python
  "q_len": 64,                        # Max query length
